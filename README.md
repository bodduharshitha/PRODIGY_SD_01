This program demonstrates the conversion of temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. 
The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. 
And then converts the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. 
For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.
And the code is written using JAVA.

Why JAVA ?

1. Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence. 
2. It uses a "write once, run anywhere" approach, allowing code to run on different devices. 
3. Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, and large-scale enterprise systems.


Temperature conversion is necessary to facilitate understanding and communication across different temperature scales. 
In this program, users can input a temperature value in one unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and the code converts it to the other two units. 
This capability ensures flexibility and clarity, allowing users to easily compare and work with temperatures in various systems, enhancing comprehension and usability.
